function Lt = sadjoint(L)
% SADJOINT  Finds a superoperator whose effect on a density matrix is the adjoint
%  of the action of the superoperator L

% If the action of superoperator L on density matrix rho is A*rho*B, where A and B are operators,
%    the action of the adjoint superoperator on rho is B'*rho*A' 
% SADJOINT operates member-wise on arrays
