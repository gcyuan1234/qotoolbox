Change log for the quantum optics toolbox
=========================================

Version 0.15, 20-Aug-02
-----------------------
1. Added calculation of superoperator adjoints
2. Added routines for truncating and permuting Hilbert spaces
3. Corrections to quantum computation routines and hyperf.m routine

Version 0.14, 28-Sep-99
-----------------------
1. Changes for Matlab 5.3 interpretation of subscripting.
2. Allow user to specify options for differential equation solver.

Version 0.13, 10-Mar-99
-----------------------
1. Quantum Computation routines.

Version 0.12, 03-Feb-99
-----------------------
1. Matrix operations (* / \ ^) between a single member quantum array object 
   and a double matrix now return a quantum array object of size equal to 
   the double matrix. The operation takes place between the quantum object
   and each element of the matrix, and is placed in the corresponding member
   of the result. e.g. destroy(4)*linspace(0,1,10) now returns a ten member
   array of quantum objects.
   

Version 0.11, 26-Jan-99
-----------------------
1. External solver calling routines (mcsolve, odesolve, sdesolve and 
   eulersolve) modified to allow user interrupts under Unix to stop
   the external programme.
2. eseries/estidy and fseries/fstidy modified to work aroung a bug 
   in the max(array,[],1) function for Matlab 5.1 when array is 
   sparse.
3. Extra functionality added to fseries to allow conjugate transpose,
   spre and spost of function series
4. fseries/mtimes modified to allow multiplication of a function series
   and a single member quantum object in either order.
