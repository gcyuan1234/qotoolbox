This toolbox was started during a period of sabbatical leave early in 1996 at Caltech in
Jeff Kimble's group. I thank Jeff and his group for their hospitality and for suggesting the
problems which motivated this undertaking. Since then, several colleagues have helped in
testing preliminary versions of the code and refining the design, notably Andrew Doherty and 
Michael Dunstan. Since the code is still very much under development, I would be grateful to 
receive reports of errors and problems or any other suggestions.

I hope that this toolbox will be expanded over time to include data structures and routines
which are useful in different areas such as quantum information theory, atomic optics and 
tomographic reconstruction. If you wish to develop or contribute routines that you would be
willing to release under the terms of the Gnu General Public License, I would be pleased to
collect them for ease of distribution.

Thanks to Eric Hsu (NIST) and to Herbert Crepaz (U. Innsbruck) for helpful corrections to some
of the routines.
