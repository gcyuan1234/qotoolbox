QUANTUM OPTICS TOOLBOX FOR MATLAB 5
===================================

This is a toolbox of routines for solving quantum mechanics problems in spaces
with moderately low dimensions. Besides the M files, it is necessary to install 
some programmes which carry out numerical integration.

Installation for IBM/PC Systems
-------------------------------
1. The archive should have been unpacked into the current directory, which 
    will be taken to be \qotoolbox in the following instructions.

2. Copy the files solvemc.bat, solvesde.bat, stochsim.bat and the associated
    executable files _solvemc.exe, _solvesde.exe and _stochsim.exe from the
    \qotoolbox\bin directory to some directory which is on the system path.

3. Start Matlab and append the toolbox directory and the examples subdirectory
    to the Matlab path. e.g.,

    >> addpath('\qotoolbox');
    >> addpath('\qotoolbox\examples');

   If you want the toolbox to be available each time Matlab is started, these
    lines should be in the user's or in the system's startup file 
    $MATLABDIR\toolbox\local\pathdef.m

4. Documentation is in the file doc/qouserguide.pdf

5. Try out the demonstration files by going into some working directory and
    entering

    >> qdemos

Installation for Unix Systems
-----------------------------
1. The .tgz file should have been unpacked into the current directory, which
    will be taken to be /home/mydir/qotoolbox in the following instructions.

2. There are three programmes for numerical integration in the directories
    unixsrc/solvemc
    unixsrc/solvesde
    unixsrc/stochsim

   If /home/mydir/bin is a directory on the path, go to each of the source
   directories in turn and compile all the C files there, as follows:

    cd /home/mydir/qotoolbox/unixsrc/solvemc
    gcc -o /home/mydir/bin/solvemc *.c -lm

    cd /home/mydir/qotoolbox/unixsrc/solvesde
    gcc -o /home/mydir/bin/solvesde *.c -lm

    cd /home/mydir/qotoolbox/unixsrc/stochsim
    gcc -o /home/mydir/bin/stochsim *.c -lm

3. Start Matlab and append the toolbox directory and the examples subdirectory
    to the Matlab path. e.g.,

    >> addpath('/home/mydir/qotoolbox');
    >> addpath('/home/mydir/qotoolbox/examples');
   
   If you want the toolbox to be available each time Matlab is started, these
    lines should be in the user's or in the system's startup file 
    $MATLABDIR/toolbox/local/pathdef.m

4. Documentation is in the file doc/qouserguide.pdf

5. Try out the demonstration files by going into some working directory and
    entering

    >> qdemos
