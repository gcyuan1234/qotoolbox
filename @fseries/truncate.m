function q1 = truncate(q,indices)
% FSERIES/TRUNCATE truncates the space of a quantum object "q" using the list of 
%  "indices". 
% e.g. if the vector space dimensions of q are [4,5,3], and we wish to truncate the
%  space by selecting directions 2:3, 1:5 and 1:2 in the subspaces, set 
%  indices = {2:3,1:5,1:2}. The output will have vector space dimensions [2,5,2]
% Alternatively, we can select a collection of individual directions. For example if
%  indices = [3,4,2; 1,4,2; 2,1,2; 4,1,3], we are selecting a four dimensional 
%  subspace spanned by directions given by the rows of indices.
